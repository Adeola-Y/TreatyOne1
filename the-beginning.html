      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <p id="the-begining-text">
        Canada believed that like the United States they must expand across
        North America. While the union of the British colonies of Canada, New
        Brunswick and Nova Scotia created a new Dominion of Canada in 1867, most
        political parties had views that called for the annexation of Rupert's
        Land, the huge territory covering the Hudson Bay watershed. The rapid
        Expansion of the United States across the West alarmed many Canadian
        politicians who feared that the United States would annex Rupert's Land.

          <h3>The Confederation</h3>
          <p>
            Immediately following the proclamation of Confederation, the
            Dominion began negotiations with Britain and the Hudson's Bay
            Company for the purchase of the Company's Charter to Rupert's Land.
            The charter was secured and full control transferred by the British
            under the Rupert's Land Act of 1868 and the Northwest Territories
            Transfer Act in 1870. The legal status of the Northwest Territories
            was a part of Canada, but the fact remained that the Territories
            were devoid of any Canadian authority and was still the domain of
            Aboriginal people. Although the Dominion had purchased the title for
            Rupert's Land, it had no way of exerting its influence or
            jurisdiction over the area.

          <h3>Treaties</h3>
          <p>
            these treaties also held clauses that were very similar to many of
            the civilisation programs undertaken in central Canada. All treaties
            had clauses for schools or teachers to educate children, and
            agricultural implements were promised to assist Aboriginal
            signatories in their transition towards an agricultural lifestyle.
            in the eyes of the Federal Government, the act of signing treaty
            brought Aboriginal people of the Northwest under the jurisdiction of
            the Dominion of Canada and its laws.

          <h3>Clauses</h3>
          <p>
            As the first of the treaties negotiated in Western Canada, Treaties
            1 and 2 concluded in 1871, have fewer clauses than the ones that
            were made after. For example, these treaties are the only ones that
            do not specify that the First Nation signatories maintain an ongoing
            right to hunt and fish in the treaty area. The amount of reserve
            lands per band was also fixed at 160 acres per family of five, a
            clause that would be repeated only for Treaties 1, 2 and 5 covering
            present day Manitoba. Furthermore, the amount of the treaty annuity
            was $3 at the time of treaty signings while those of all other
            Numbered Treaties would be $5.
