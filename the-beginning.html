        We acknowledge being on Treaty One territory and commit to moving
        forward in partnership with Indigenous communities towards
        reconciliation. We recognize that we are gathered on Treaty 1 Territory
        and that Manitoba is located on the Treaty Territories and ancestral
        lands of the Anishinaabeg, Anishininewuk, Dakota Oyate, Denesuline, and
        Nehethowuk Nations.

      <h2>The Beginning</h2>
      <p id="styling-for-text-">
        Canada believed that like the United States they must expand across
        North America. While the union of the British colonies of Canada, New
        Brunswick and Nova Scotia created a single block new Dominion of Canada
        in 1867, most political parties had views that called for the annexation
        of Rupert's Land, the huge territory covering the Hudson Bay watershed.
        The rapid Expansion of the United States across the West alarmed many
        Canadian politicians who feared that the United States would annex
        Rupert's Land.

          <h2>The Confederation</h2>
          <p>
            Immediately following the proclamation of Confederation, the
            Dominion began negotiations with Britain and the Hudson's Bay
            Company for the purchase of the Company's Charter to Rupert's Land.
            The charter was secured and full control transferred by the British
            under the Rupert's Land Act of 1868 and the Northwest Territories
            Transfer Act in 1870. The legal status of the Northwest Territories
            being a part of Canada, the fact remained that the Territories were
            devoid of any Canadian authority and was still the domain of
            Aboriginal people. Although the Dominion had purchased the title for
            Rupert's Land, it had no way of exerting its influence or
            jurisdiction over the area.

        these treaties also held clauses that were very similar to many of the
        civilisation programs undertaken in central Canada. All treaties had
        clauses for schools or teachers to educate children, and agricultural
        implements were promised to assist Aboriginal signatories in their
        transition towards an agricultural lifestyle. in the eyes of the Federal
        Government, the act of signing treaty brought Aboriginal people of the
        Northwest under the jurisdiction of the Dominion of Canada and its laws.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the first of the treaties negotiated in Western Canada, Treaties 1
        and 2 concluded in 1871, have fewer clauses than in the ones that would
        follow. For example, these treaties are the only ones that do not
        specify that the First Nation signatories maintain an ongoing right to
        hunt and fish in the treaty area. The amount of reserve lands per band
        was also fixed at 160 acres per family of five, a clause that would be
        repeated only for Treaties 1, 2 and 5 covering present day Manitoba.
        Furthermore, the amount of the treaty annuity was $3 at the time of
        treaty signings while those of all other Numbered Treaties would be $5.
