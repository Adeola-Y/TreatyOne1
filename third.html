        We acknowledge being on Treaty One territory and commit to moving
        forward in partnership with Indigenous communities towards
        reconciliation. We recognize that we are gathered on Treaty 1 Territory
        and that Manitoba is located on the Treaty Territories and ancestral
        lands of the Anishinaabeg, Anishininewuk, Dakota Oyate, Denesuline, and

      <h2>Modern Day Treaties</h2>
      <p id="modern-day-text">
        Modern treaties, also known as Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements, are
        concluded over long periods of time and contain a high level of detail.
        Are usually between Indigenous peoples, the federal and provincial Crown
        and in some cases, a territory.These treaties enable Indigenous peoples
        to rebuild their communities and nations on their own terms. A great
        example of this would be the formerly part of Canadian Forces Base in
        Winnipeg.

            The former Military base Kenaston Boulevard closed in 2004, when its

          <h3>Who Bought The Land:</h3>
          <p>
            On August 30, 2019, Canada and the Treaty One First Nations signed a
            Comprehensive Settlement Agreement, based on the shared
            understandings outlined in the April 2018 Agreement in Principle.
            The agreement was to sell 68% of the Kapyong Barracks land to the
            Treaty One First Nations. The remaining 32% of the property was to
            be sold to the Canada Lands Company CLC Limited for redevelopment.
            the demolition contract was also under the Federal Government
            Setâ€‘Aside for Aboriginal Business, in accordance with the
            Procurement Strategy for Aboriginal Business (PSAB)
