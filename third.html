        We acknowledge being on Treaty One territory and commit to moving
        forward in partnership with Indigenous communities towards
        reconciliation. We recognize that we are gathered on Treaty 1 Territory
        and that Manitoba is located on the Treaty Territories and ancestral
        lands of the Anishinaabeg, Anishininewuk, Dakota Oyate, Denesuline, and
        Nehethowuk Nations.

      <h2>Modern Day Treaties</h2>
      <p id="modern-day-text">
        Modern treaties, also known as Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements, are
        concluded over long periods of time and contain a high level of detail.
        Are usually between Indigenous peoples, the federal and provincial Crown
        and in some cases, a territory.These treaties enable Indigenous peoples
        to rebuild their communities and nations on their own terms. A great
        example of this would be the formerly part of Canadian Forces Base in
        Winnipeg.
