            Treaty No. 1 was the first of the numbered treaties that helped
            establish Western Canada, and was made with the understanding that
            the Treaty would be in place for “as long as the sun shines, the
            grass grows and the river flows”. Indigenous peoples have lived on
            the land we now call Canada for thousands of years, with their own
            unique cultures, identities, traditions, languages and institutions.
            Treaties are agreements between the Crown and the First Nation
            signatories to establish how each would coexist within the territory
            of the treaty. Treaty No. 1 is the first in a series of 11 treaties
            made between 1871 and 1921.

            project not only for the Treaty One First Nations, but also for
            Winnipeg, Manitoba, and Canada, for generations to come.
