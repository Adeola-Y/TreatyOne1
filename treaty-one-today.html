      <h2>Modern Day Treaties</h2>
      <p id="modern-day-text">
        Modern treaties, also known as Comprehensive Land Claims Agreements, are
        concluded over long periods of time and contain a high level of detail.
        Are usually between Indigenous peoples, the federal and provincial Crown
        and in some cases, a territory.These treaties enable Indigenous peoples
        to rebuild their communities and nations on their own terms. A great
        example of this would be the formerly part of Canadian Forces Base in
        Winnipeg.

          <h3>Kapyong Barracks:</h3>
          <p>
            The former Military base Kenaston Boulevard closed in 2004, when its
            occupants moved to Canadian Forces Base Shilo, near Brandon. After
            determining that the Canadian Armed Forces no longer had an
            operational need for the property, the Department of National
            Defence (DND) received approval to sell the property to the Canada
            Lands Company CLC Limited in 2007. First Nations seeked to enforce
            their rights (as treaty land entitlements) under modern agreements
            with Canada went to court on the fact that Canada never fulfilled
            the requirements stated in their treaty. As the Federal Court of
            Appeal found, Canada “broke the solemn promise it made”.

          <h3>Who Bought The Land:</h3>
          <p>
            On August 30, 2019, Canada and the Treaty One First Nations signed a
            Comprehensive Settlement Agreement, based on the shared
            understandings outlined in the April 2018 Agreement in Principle.
            The agreement was to sell 68% of the Kapyong Barracks land to the
            Treaty One First Nations. The remaining 32% of the property was to
            be sold to the Canada Lands Company CLC Limited for redevelopment.
            the demolition contract was also under the Federal Government
            Set‑Aside for Aboriginal Business, in accordance with the
            Procurement Strategy for Aboriginal Business (PSAB).

          <h3>Future Plans</h3>
          <p>
            DND is demolishing on-site infrastructure at the Kapyong Barracks.
            The first phase of demolition was completed in May 2019, and the
            remaining demolition work was completed in the fall of 2021. The
            final master plan shows the site could have up to three thousand new
            residences and 1.2 million square feet of commercial space. The
            168-acre site will also have space for sports and recreation
            facilities, community spaces and an administration centre for Treaty
            1 First Nations. In 2021, the Treaty One Nations named the property
            Naawi-Oodena, which means “centre of the heart and community” in the
            Anishinaabe language. The concept of an urban reserve allows First
            Nations to use land within the city to develop for commercial
            purposes and generate revenue for their community.

          in modern Winnipeg history and the single largest, strategically
