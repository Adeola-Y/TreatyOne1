/* 
  I chose the colors yellow and red because they both are bright and intense which is why they
  bring out such strong feelings which is what I wanted to happen. Yellow represnts happiness 
  and hope but can also be a sign of caution which is something I wanted to be prevalent which is
  why it is my backgroun color. Red is associated with courage, sacrifice and being brave which is
  why I used it for my text and a different deeper red for Headings. Both Yellow and red are colors
  that are used to express something and I wanted to use these colors because I thought that those 
  colors represent Indigenous peoples and what thy've gone through while still being resilient. 
  I used sans serif font because it is modern, clean, and is easier to read. In the beginning I was
  creating a website for people around my age and I wanted a font type that is modern but trustworthy 
  and sans serif font can be used for multiple different purposes.
